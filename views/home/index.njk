        <p>Hi, I'm Konrad.</p>

        <p>Software Developer with passion for Web Development and Cloud Computing.</p>

        <p>Currently living in Boston after having lived seven years in Zurich where I studied Electrical Engineering &amp; Information Technology at ETH Zurich and where I started my first job at HP.</p>

        <p>I love to code, I love great Software Design and I love creating great products - this is what really drives me both at work and in my free time. Of course, that is not the only thing I enjoy spending my time with. Making music is one of my passions since I was a kid and I still spend a lot of time with my electric guitar and piano.</p>
